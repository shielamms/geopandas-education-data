## Geopandas for Maps of Education Data

This is a code repository of geopandas maps used to visualise and analyse education data from public datasets. Most of the code here are in Jupyter notebooks. To be able to execute the code and/or refresh the maps, create a python virtual environment and install the packages in `requirements.txt`.

```
pyenv install 3.8.8
pyenv local 3.8.8
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
